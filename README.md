# Recommendation-and-Prediction-System-using-Content-Based-Filtering-and-Random-Forest-Classifier
This repository is about using cosine similarity for content based filtering and predicting the likelihood of customer making the repeated purchase.

## This project combines two functionalities:

* Book Recommendation System: Users can search for books and receive recommendations based on similarity scores calculated using cosine similarity.
* Repeat Purchase Prediction: Predicts the probability of a customer making a repeated purchase based on various input features such as tenure, preferred login device, satisfaction score, etc.

## Features
### Book Recommendation System:
* Displays popular books and allows users to search for books and get recommendations.
* Uses cosine similarity to suggest books similar to the user's input.

### Repeat Purchase Prediction:
* Predicts whether a customer will make a repeated purchase using a pre-trained Random Forest Classifier model.
* Users input various customer attributes to get predictions and probabilities.

## Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
